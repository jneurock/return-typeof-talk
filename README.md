An Ember application to accompany my talk on JavaScripts types

To build this project you will need node.js and gulp

Clone the repo and then run `npm install`

You can then run `gulp dev`, `gulp prod` or simply `gulp`

To read more about the gulp tasks see my [Viking Base](https://github.com/jneurock/viking-base) project
